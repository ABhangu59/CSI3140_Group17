## How To Play Yahtzee! 

1. **Rolling the Dice**: You have five dice and can roll them up to three times per turn.
2. **Choosing Dice to Keep**: After each roll, decide which dice to keep and which to reroll by clicking on the dice. You can keep any number of dice after each roll.
3. **Scoring**: At the end of your turn (after up to three rolls), you choose a category to score your dice. Categories include:
    - **Upper Section**: Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, Sixes (score is the sum of the dice showing that number)
    - **Lower Section**: Three of a Kind, Four of a Kind, Full House, Small Straight, Large Straight, Yahtzee, Chance (each category has specific scoring rules)
4. **Filling the Scorecard**: Each category can only be used once, so choose wisely to maximize your score.
5. **Winning**: The player with the highest total score after all categories have been filled wins.
